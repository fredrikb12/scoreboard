# Tennis Scoreboard

## Description

A basic tennis scoreboard for two players, keeping track of your score within one game.

- Zero points is written as "Love".
- One point is written as "15".
- Two points is written as "30".
- Three points is written as "40".
- If both players have at least three points and the same amount, it will be written as "Deuce".
- If one player has a lead and both have at least three points, the leader will have "Adv".
- When the game ends, you can restart, and your scores will say "Winner" and "Loser" respectively.
